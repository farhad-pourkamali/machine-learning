# Machine Learning 

This course is an *introduction* to machine learning concepts, techniques, and algorithms. Topics include regression analysis, statistical and probabilistic methods, parametric and non-parametric methods, classification, clustering, and neural networks. This course covers both foundational and practical aspects by (1) discussing the motivations behind popular machine learning algorithms; (2) developing a mathematical foundation for the methods of machine learning; (3) writing programs in Python for implementing machine learning algorithms; and (4) evaluating the designed systems to determine whether they work well for a particular task.

## Course Structure

- Part 1: Fundamentals of Machine Learning
    - Review of Pythonâ€™s main scientific libraries: NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
    - Steps in a typical machine learning project
    - Learning by fitting a model to data and optimizing a cost function 
    - Linear regression, regularization, logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees/random forests, ensemble learning, K-means clustering, DBSCAN
    - Challenges of using machine learning systems

- Part 2: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
    - What neural nets are and what they are good for 
    - Building and training feedforward neural nets or multilayer perceptrons (MLPs)
    - Understanding different forms of gradient descent (e.g., Nesterov, RMSProp, and Adam)
    - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for deep computer vision and recurrent neural nets (RNNs)
